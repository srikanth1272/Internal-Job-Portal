# Internal Job Portal
Internal job portal means advertising open job positions in the company itself to hire existing employees for open opportunities.
Today, companies prefer internal recruitment to fill roles in their business that are best compatible and have internal knowledge about the work culture. It is an important method of recruiting as it saves time, money, and efforts of hiring from outside. It also reduces attrition. 
The internal job posting, also known as IJP, has become easier to retain existing employees and giving them new job roles.
